# AxonSeg: Axon Segmentation Toolbox
Segment axon and myelin from microscopy data. Written in Matlab (R2014a).

**ANNOUNCEMENT: AxonSeg software now has a little brother: [AxonDeepSeg](https://axondeepseg.readthedocs.io), which is based on deep-learning and provides better performance. We encourage you to switch to AxonDeepSeg**
